## Installed Packages

1. express  //for routing
2. nodemon // live update without restarting node
3. camelcase // tested if npm package worked on my own server.

## Templating
Templating is another language for a more dynamic page. When your requesting files from a database and want to show it on the browser, the templating engine (in my case EJS) will convert the code to HTML to be read in the browser.

Why EJS?
This engine was the first mentioned in the list, so I will stick with this the in my Dating app.
